# Clear channel.

This may be a bug in the code, caused by the initialization of certain variables at "-1".
They should be "-3".

- Implemented, but not tested.

# Start rotating to the left.

I may have a bug somewhere. It seems clearing the channel is not everything. At the first command,
if I press at some point, instead of dragging the joystick and immediately release, sometimes the
car keeps spinning.

# Power distribution.

Some of the motors perform better than the other. I would like to implement, as part of the settings,
a seek bar to configure more power to be set on the less performance motor.

- Implemented, but the right motor only ranges from 0 to 63.

# Spinner (drop-down list) in settings and style

The spinner looks just terrible. According to material design it should look different.

# ConnectToDeviceTask needs to be static

I may have a memory leak. Inner classes may always have memory leaks if not handled properly.

# MainActivity style seems to change when rotating.

The list fragment seems to change the style when the screen changes from portrait to landscape.

# Settings , the state is not persisted during screen configuration changes

I need to persist state information during screen orientation changes.

# Screen orientation

When the landscape mode is set, I do not save the state. Which makes the activity try to connect
to the bluetooth device again. Since it already is connected, the attempt fails and closes the
activity.

- Implemented.

# Attempts to reconnect to bluetooth device

If you are in the joystick activity and press back, you go back to the list of devices. If you click
on the device again, it does not re-connect. It keeps spinning and spinning.

- Implemented
