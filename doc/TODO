# In Settings, Balance text field always defaults to 100 / 100

If power distribution has been changed and we leave the settings fragment and go back again,
the seek bar has the right setting but the balance text field is 100 / 100.

- Implemented, but not tested

# Power distribution.

Some of the motors perform better than the other. I would like to implement, as part of the settings,
a seek bar to configure more power to be set on the less performance motor.

- Implemented, but the right motor only ranges from 0 to 63.

# Spinner (drop-down list) in settings and style

The spinner looks just terrible. According to material design it should look different.

# ConnectToDeviceTask needs to be static

I may have a memory leak. Inner classes may always have memory leaks if not handled properly.

# MainActivity style seems to change when rotating.

The list fragment seems to change the style when the screen changes from portrait to landscape.

# Settings , the state is not persisted during screen configuration changes

I need to persist state information during screen orientation changes.
